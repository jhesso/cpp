TODO:

Input validation:
	- [x] only accept positive numbers
	- [x] no duplicates
	- [x] handle integer overflows

Algo:
	- Vector:
		- the whole fuckint thing :D
	- List:
		- same here

everything but the actual sorting is done (I think) :prayge:

at least for now, 0 is not accepted as a valid number. should prolly check with
some others and see what they think.
	At least mcombeau and dgerguri both think that 0 is not valid
